# 🎯 Quotes Application (Part 2) - Search and Filtering
.

## 🏗️ Problem Definition

Enhance the existing Quotes API by adding search and filtering capabilities to the GET `/quotes` endpoint, allowing users to find specific quotes based on content and author criteria. This application will provide enhanced quote management system with the following capabilities:

- **Enhanced Quote Retrieval**: Support optional filtering parameters for quote content and author
- **Flexible Search**: Case-insensitive partial matching for both quote content and author names
- **Combined Filtering**: Multiple search criteria applied simultaneously with AND logic
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain existing functionality while adding new search features

The system is designed to be stateless and RESTful, following standard HTTP conventions and JSON data formats.
