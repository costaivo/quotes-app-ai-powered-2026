# Contributing

Thanks for contributing! This document contains minimal bootstrapping notes for developer setup in this monorepo.

## Local setup

- Install Node (use the project's `.nvmrc` files or `nvm use` to pick the correct Node LTS)
- Install dependencies at the root and in `app/be` and `app/fe` as needed

## Where to find rules

- Backend rules: `app/be/be-rules`
- Frontend rules: `app/fe/fe-rules`

## CI and workflow

- CI placeholder: `/.github/workflows/ci.yml` (expand jobs to run build/test)
